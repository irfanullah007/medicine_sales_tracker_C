The ‘Mediaid Pharmaceutical Company Limited’ has launched its new product ‘Diacine’ into the market. So, to distribute the product to Dhaka, they recruit 5 medical representatives. The tasks of the medical representatives are to sell the products to different hospitals and pharmacies and to collect feedback from the buyers. 

Inputs:  Name, Area, ID, Total Amount of Selling Products of the medical representatives, and feedback from the buyers. 

Outputs:  In the output, the feedback of the medical representatives from their selling perspective, and the best seller of the month among all the medical representatives (based on the amount of selling products) will be shown using an intuitive menu option. 

Techniques to be used:

2) Two functions are used to show the feedback of the representatives and to evaluate the best seller of the month. 
3) A string function (strstr) and pointers are used for a function that gives the feedback of the representatives. 
4) Conditional statements are used in both functions.
